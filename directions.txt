This is probably the simplest and easiest game you will play, so sorry to people who were looking for a challenge. Maybe if you are struggling with other people's games you can play my game for a moral boost. Click anywhere within the bounds (white rectangle) to place a football, your character will spawn at a random location on the left side. Just use the arrow keys to move to the ball and then the endzone (red squares) or press 'a' to use A* to get to the ball and then 'a' again to get to the endzone. Avoid the defenders.
